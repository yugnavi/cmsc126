                            The College of Science and Mathematics (CSM) was created on July 1, 1997 by virtue of the Board of Regent’s approval
                            of a proposal by Dean Rogelio V. Cuyno. The faculty and staff of the School of Agri-Systems and Environment (SASE)
                            as well as the Natural Science and Mathematics Cluster of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) were re-assigned to
                            the new College. On the other hand, the Humanities and Social Sciences Clusters of the old College of Arts and Sciences
                            became the new College of Humanities and Social Sciences. The SASE and CAS were effectively dissolved with the formation
                            of the new units. The Board’s approval provided that a Director who will function as the Dean of the College would head
                            CSM.
